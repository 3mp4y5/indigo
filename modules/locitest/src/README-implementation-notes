Notes on testing

When populating scalar values, the first is set to 1 and thereafter the
value used is incremented.  When a bunch of scalars are set or checked
by a function, the current value being used is returned.  It is assumed
that this will never be 0 (no roll over) as "check" will return 0 
when a failure occurs.
